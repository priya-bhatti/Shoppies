# Shoppies
<p><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">TMBD</a> was used instead of OMDB in order to obtain movie posters for free</p>
<p>Due to limited time, a non-responsive version of "The Shoppies" was completed. I would have liked to make the webpage responsive using media queries so that the layout suited varying screens(the header text especially). I've included a prototype of what a mobile layout would've looked like:</p>
<div style="display: inline-block;"> 
<img src="images/X - 1 - 4 nominations.png" width="25%"></img>
<img src="images/X - 1 - 5 nominations.png" width="25%"></img>
<img src="images/X - 1 - view nominations.png" width="25%"></img>
</div>
